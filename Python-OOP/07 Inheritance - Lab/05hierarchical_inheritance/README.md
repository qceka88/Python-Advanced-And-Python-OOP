5.	Hierarchical Inheritance


In a folder called project create three files: animal.py, dog.py, and cat.py.
In each file, create its corresponding class - Animal, Dog, and Cat:

•	Animal with a single method eat() that returns: "eating..."

•	Dog with a single method bark() that returns: "barking..."

•	Cat with a single method meow() that returns: "meowing..."


Both Dog and Cat should inherit from Animal.
Submit in Judge a zip file of the folder project.
